          Broo where do I even start ? <br />
          I know I can’t really put into words the journey & bond we share. But let me try penning down a few things. You're one of those rare ones whom I can share anything & everything with and on this spcl day of urs, I need to mention about the grace & charm that u carry through in any situation.
          I mean you're the ease in smartness, the zeal in hardwork & the belief in patience - which is truly inspiring. And also the amount of luv & thought u pour into each one of us is my most favourite.. I think I don’t need to mention muchh cz we know that we’ll always be there for eachother no matter wht😏🧿♾️
          Honestly, I didn’t expect us to hold onto the same bond while being miles apart. But here we are.. uhuuu!😎🤟
          Even though I miss your physical presence, I really love how we still find ways to share voices and vibes. I hope that continues — no matter how busy life gets, let’s keep showing up for each other, even if just on weekends.
          I wish for all of us to become so busy chasing dreams, that we literally wait for those blast moments to catch up and laugh like crazy.
          And you have no idea how happy I feel every single time you welcome me to Chennai — it’s always so warm, so you. 
          Things might take time but definetely we'll work for it. I just hope & wish u have great health, success & happiness throughout the year✨ <br />
          I love you soo soo muchh🤍🫂💋 <br />
          Wishing you Happiest 21st Birthday Pranee!!🍾🥂 <br />

          <p className="wish-message">Remember the first time I wrote you a letter?? <br />
I was sitting next to you. And I wrote it in OS class? I don’t remember. <br />
I think that the fact that i even gave you a hand written letter is a huge deal for me. <br />
You should know that. <br />
I know , i know , you wrote me back on my birthday. You put pictures of us. And you wrote.</p>

<p className="wish-message">
I still have your earphones ( they are shit) but they helped me go through some tough shit too. <br />
I got new ones btw, if we were together , I would’ve prolly made a huge fuss outtta it and keep pestering you about it and you would’ve gladly sat w me through it. 
Remember how we always end up choosing my birthday outfits? <br />
It’s your birthday today and I will not be there for it.</p>

<p className="wish-message">You know it always felt weird to me when you text something that makes me feel important. <br />
Like ohh I’m important to you. <br />
Weird is not the word. Surprise. <br />
Surprise is the word. Like heyyy you like me and prolly love me. <br />
Always make me happy. <br />
It’s just so easy to be around you. <br /> 
I’ve always been myself around you. <br />
Like “ I don’t care if i have oil on my head” or I don’t care if i didn’t shower. <br />
Prolly because I’m such a fire cracker and you are such a lemme just look at the cracker. <br />
You know when I’m really comfortable w someone I wouldn’t wanna make my presence known? <br />
When I’m w you I never had this urge to do smth to draw attention. <br />
Because it didn’t matter i  guess. <br />
Thank you for always letting me blabber shit.</p>

<p className="wish-message">Just read your email. <br />
THE FACT THAT YOU SENT A FUCKING EMAIL TO ME. Is this how it feels to be loved? <br />
I mean yeah not Romeo and Juliet level shit but <br />
I’d take this. And the fact that you also wanted to make some website for me? <br />
Damn. <br />
Damn. <br />
I’m speechless 😔. </p>


<p className="wish-message">Yes , things have been little intense and I’m still tryna balance my life. <br />
I’m sorry that we do not talk anymore. I’m so sorry. <br />
I feel so bad that we do not talk anymore. <br />
University feels so far away. <br />
That life. And I hate it.</p>

<p className="wish-message">But im always one call away. <br />
You know that right? <br />
I’m always one call away ( prolly 10 if I’m in a meeting) </p>

To the one who bribes me into going to college. <br />
To the one who celebrated my birthday in college when they didn’t have to. <br />
